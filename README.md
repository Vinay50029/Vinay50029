I am excited to share details about my first project, a website dedicated to the BMW M4 EVO. Users can find basic information about BMW and its M series. The website includes detailed car views, a short video, and information about various parts of the vehicle. There is also an option to visit the showroom via integrated maps. At the end of the site, there is a section about the creator and links to BMW's social media.
The Test Drive section redirects to another page with its own navigation bar, a brief video showcasing the BMW driving experience, and a test drive form. I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, driven by my passion and interest in BMW cars.
